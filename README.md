# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Project Overview:
This project was about building a React app called Greeting Cards. The app has three main parts: a Header, a GreetingCard for showing messages, and an App to put everything together. I learned how to use React components, pass Properties , and style with Tailwind CSS.

Discussion:
This project helped me understand React better. I learned how to make components work together and fix errors with file imports and directories. Working with Tailwind CSS was not really difficult once everything was set up. # greeting-cards
